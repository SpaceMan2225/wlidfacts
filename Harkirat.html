        <p> I live in a family of four people. I have a little brother, And my mom and dad.My age is 12, as of this year.I live in san deigo.
            It is a great place to visit. I have deen on many trips.
             I can proudly say that I have been to all the atractions in the western side of the USA.
              My favorite trip though, was when I went to the redwoods.I am a a more of naturistic guy I would pick snorcling or horse riding over disneyland any day.
               like A lot of people have asked me,
               "What Is thet thing on your head?"It is called a patka, you can call it a turbun. It is on my head 
               because of my religion. My religion is Sikh. It means learner.       
           I have some websites my favorite being my <a href="Home.html">animal research project</a> It is a
        website where you can find almost all the information on any animal! My first project was
         <a href="research.html">a tic tac toe game </a>It is a very cool looking project to try out.If you wish to contact me fill out this <a href="contact.html">contact form </a>These are some pictures of me:  </p>
